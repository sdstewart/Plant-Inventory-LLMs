32430. RYTILIX GRANULARIS (IL) Skeels.
(Cenekrus granularis L., 1771, Mantisa Plantarum, p 575.)
The seeds of this grass were received under the name Meniauris granuleris Swartz, 1738 (Nova Genera et Species Plantarum, p. 25), which is based on Cencheus granuleris 1 .. However, Linnaeus had published in 1771 (Mantina Plantarum, pp. 161, 300) the generic name Mamisuris with one species Af. myurus, which is not now considered to be congeneric with Cenekrus granuleris L., thus invalidating the use of the generic name Mamisuris for the latter species. This fact was recognized by Kuntze, who proposed foe Cenekeus granmlerix La. the name Harkelochloa (Revisão Generum Plantaruan, 1891, pt. 2, p. 776). However, in 1830, Seringe (Bulletin Botanique, vol. 1. p. 219) had published the generic name Rytilix, citing " Manicuris granularis et myurus Auct." and listing one species, R. glanduloss. While there is no description, the facts that M. granularis was cited first, that the name R, glandulost is proposed and that "giandulosa" and "granularis" are considered to refer to the same plant characteristic, lead one to consider Maniauris granularis to be the type of the genus Rytilix.

(Aegilops eraltala In, 1371, Mantina Plantarum, p. 575.)
(Opkiures corymoson Gaertner f. 1805, Fructibus et Seminibus Plan- tarum, vol. 3, p. 3, pl. 181.)
The seeds of this grams were received under the name Ophiaros corymboss (L. L.) Gaertn. f. In publishing the genus Ophiuros, Gaertner cited Rott- 282

boellia Linn, and Jums,, and described and figured two species, Under the first, O, incurrata, are cited the descriptions of Aegilops incurvata L, and Rott- borllia incurrala L. f. Under the second. O. corymboas, are cited the descrip- tions of Argilopa ezaltata L. and Rottboellie corymbosa L., f., the latter of which is based on Argilopa czeltota, the specific name being changed because of Rott- boellia eralista I. t. appearing earlier on the same page of the Supplementum (1781, p. 114). The generic characterization covers both graves; but the first species is more completely described, Gaertner not having any fertile flowers of the second, of which he remarks that it might prove to be very closely related to Digitaria if the flowers were better known, It would therefore reem neces- vary to consider the first species, O. incurrots, as the type of the genus Ophiuros, As Aegilops exaltata is not now considered to be congeneric with O. incurvala it must be referred to another gervas. In 1829, Kunth (Revision des Graminées, vol. 1, p. 153) published the genus Mmesithea with one species, M. ferris, based on Rottboellia lorris Retzius. As this grass is considered to be congeneric with the speeles received as Ophiuros corymboss, the latter is here placed in the genus Mnesithea, the earliest specific name, ezaltofu, being restored.
