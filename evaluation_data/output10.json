However, Linnaeus had published in 1771 (Mantina Plantarum, pp. 161, 300) the generic name Mamisuris with one species Af. myurus, which is not now considered to be congeneric with Cenekrus granuleris L., thus invalidating the use of the generic name Mamisuris for the latter species. This fact was recognized by Kuntze, who proposed foe Cenekeus granmlerix La. the name Harkelochloa (Revis\u00e3o Generum Plantaruan, 1891, pt. 2, p. 776). However, in 1830, Seringe (Bulletin Botanique, vol. 1. p. 219) had published the generic name Rytilix, citing \" Manicuris granularis et myurus Auct.\" and listing one species, R. glanduloss. While there is no description, the facts that M. granularis was cited first, that the name R, glandulost is proposed and that \"giandulosa\" and \"granularis\" are considered to refer to the same plant characteristic, lead one to consider Maniauris granularis to be the type of the genus Rytilix. \"(No. 142, October 14, 1911.)
