32405. TRITICUM AESTIVUM L. Wheat.
From Krasny Koot, Samara Government, Russia.
"(No. 1707a, November 20, 1911.) Variety graceum, A variety of soft summer wheat, called Khivinskaia, coming originally from dry and hot Khiva, Russian Turkestan. This grain at Krassny Koot, however, was received from a firm in Germany named Dreifus. This wheat produces a flour especially suitable for biscuit making and may be found valuable in America for this purpose." (Meyer.)
32406. AGROPYRON CRISTATUM (L.) Beauv.
From near Sarepta, Saratov Government, Russia.
"*(No. 1708a, November 28, 1911.) A form of this very promising fodder grass, occurring on very sandy, dry hill slopes in the vicinity of Sarepta. Of value for sandy landa in the semiarid belt of the United States." ( Meyer.) 32407. AGROPYRON #P.
. From near Sarepta, Saratov Government, Russia.
** (No. 1709a, November 28, 1911.) A grass occurring here and there on very randy soil. Grows in clumps. Of value as a forage grass on dry, sandy lands in the semiarid belt of the United States." ( Meyer.)
32408. MEDICAGO SATIVA VARIA (Mart.) Urban. Sand lucern.
From Kramny Koot, Samara Government, Russia.
"(No. 1710a, November 20, 1911.) A very strong growing hybrid alfalfa having erect heavy stems which are well supplied with foliage. Obtained from Mr. W. S. Bogdan, at Krassny Koot, who is making extensive selection and hybridization experiments with Medicago falcata and has obtained a number of very promising types, some of which are suitable for raising exclusively for hay, while others are better for pasturing purposes.
"The climate around Krassny Koot is of a severely continental nature. The summers are hot and dry and the winters long and cold, with very little snow, as a rule. The medicagos selected there may prove especially suited to the drier portions of the western United States. The plant from which these seeds came bears Mr. Bogdan's No. 158, and is one of his best types." (Meyer.)
32409. MEDICAGO FALCATA L.
From near Sarepta, Saratov Government, Russia.
"(No. 1711a, November 28, 1911.) An alfalfa of moderate growth occurring on very sandy, dry hill slopes in a country where there is much limestone forma- tion, Probably there are several types or, perhaps, even species in this lot of seed. To be tested in dry, sandy localities." ( Meyer.)
32410. MEDICAGO sp.
From near Sarepta, Saratov Government, Russia.
"(No. 1712a, December 1, 1911.) An alfalfa occurring on dry, elevated lands along a ditch, of robust almost erect growth. Is either a form of Medicago falcata or M. coerulea which has been collected near Sarepta. Suitable for dry situations." ( Meyer.)
32411. MEDICAGO FALCATA LA.
From near Saratov, Russia.
"(No. 1713a, November 23, 1911.) An alfalfa of erect growth, found on dry, stony places on the hills near Saratov." (Meyer.)

From Krasny Koot, Samara Government, Russia.
"(No. 1714a, November 29, 1911.) This seed was presented by Mr. W. S. Bogdan. Among it there are all possible types, and it is recommended, there- fore, for general naturalization purposes and should be sown in a dry northern locality for the selection of promising types." ( Meyer.)
32413. ASTRAGALUS ALBICAULIS DC.
From near Sarepta, Saratov Government, Russia.
"(No. 1715a, November 28, 1911.) This plant occurs on dry, sandy hill slopes. Looks to be promising as a possible fodder plant for semiarid regions." ( Meyer.)
Distribution .- The Caucasus region of southeastern Rusda,
32414. CORONILLA VARIA L.
From near Saratov, Russia.
"(No. 1716a, November 23, 1911.) A perennial legume, found on dry hill slopes and in locss ravines. Roots sent under No. 993 (S. P. I. No. 32305): see this number for further remarks." ( Meyer.)

32416. BRASSICA JUNCEA (I .. ) CASS. Mustard.
From Sarepta, Saratov Government, Russia.
"(No. 1718a, December 1, 1911.) Seed of the famous Sarepta mustard, which is extraordinarily strong and in great favor throughout Russia, To possess the right pungency this mustard requires a rich, blackish soil and a hot and dry summer, with nights not too warm. The region around Sarepta seems to supply such a climate, the summers being warm enough to ripen grapes in the open, although the vines are buried deeply in winter. It may be that this short, hot summer assists in making this mustard so strong, for the manager of a large mustard factory stated that seeds from Sarepta mustard grown in Tambov Government, a region also having black soil, but slightly cooler, do not possess the required strength, India-grown seed also was not as pungent as that cultivated near Sarepta. This may possibly be grown to ad- vantage in certain sections of eastern Oregon.
"The seeds, besides being ground into powder, are often eaten sprinkled over fried meats or mixed in sauces and when used in this manner they give dishes an agreeable, spiey flavor. The oil expressed from them is not at all strong and is in very great demand for culinary purposes in the section around Sarepta, being much preferred to sunflower-seed oil, as the mustard is less adulterated.
"These seeds were obtained from the manager of the well-known mustard factory of J. C. Glitch, in Sarepta." (Meyer-)

"(No. 1719a, November 28, 1911.) A genuine wild apple, occurring in the ravines in the vicinity of Sarepta. Sometimes seen as solitary shrubby speci- mens, sometimes as medium-sized trees in groves. The fruits are said to be very variable as regards size, flavor, and color.

From Rostov, Russia.
"(No. 1721a, December 12. 1911.) A very large variety of hazelnut, said to come from Persia, called Persisty kurishowi. This name may be fictitious, as Armenian fruit dealers in Rostov are unreliable." ( Meyer.)
