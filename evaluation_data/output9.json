Seed of the famous Sarepta mustard, which is extraordinarily strong and in great favor throughout Russia. To possess the right pungency this mustard requires a rich, blackish soil and a hot and dry summer, with nights not too warm. The region around Sarepta seems to supply such a climate, the summers being warm enough to ripen grapes in the open, although the vines are buried deeply in winter. It may be that this short, hot summer assists in making this mustard so strong, for the manager of a large mustard factory stated that seeds from Sarepta mustard grown in Tambov Government, a region also having black soil, but slightly cooler, do not possess the required strength. India-grown seed also was not as pungent as that cultivated near Sarepta. This may possibly be grown to advantage in certain sections of eastern Oregon. The seeds, besides being ground into powder, are often eaten sprinkled over fried meats or mixed in sauces and when used in this manner they give dishes an agreeable, spicy flavor. The oil expressed from them is not at all strong and is in very great demand for culinary purposes in the section around Sarepta, being much preferred to sunflower-seed oil, as the mustard is less adulterated. These seeds were obtained from the manager of the well-known mustard factory of J. C. Glitch, in Sarepta.
