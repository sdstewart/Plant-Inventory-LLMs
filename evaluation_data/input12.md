Presented by Mr. Walter Fischer, Campo de Cultura Experimental Paraense, Para, Brazil. Received February 27, 1912.
Seeds of the following; quoted notes by Mr. Fischer:
32914. SAPINDUS sp.
"A species of Sapindus, which I found along a roadside about 6 miles from Santarem. The tree grows to a height of 30 to 40 feet and is found along the borders of clearings. The natives were familiar with the saponifying property of the seeds, but as far as I could learn made no use of them. Santarem is located at the north of the Tapajos on the Amazon, about 500 miles from Para."
32915 and 32916. PITHECOLOBIUM UNGUIS-CATI (L.) Benth.
"Two varieties of seeds that I found and collected in Barbados. The local name is 'bread and cheese.' The seeds are from a very attractive ornamental small tree much used as a border shrub and as a hedge plant for which latter purpose it is well adapted. It has a clean foliage of compound leaves, each leaf consisting of a twin pair of obovate leaflets. What makes the plant most conspicuous and attractive is its heavy burden of dense panicles of pods, open and twisted when ripe and showing the shiny-black small seeds to each of which is attached a red or a white arillus. This hedge plant would be excellently adapted to southern Florida where it may already exist."
32915. "Seed with white aril." 32916. "Seed with red aril."
Distribution .- Sandy soil in southern Florida and in the West Indies and the tropical part of South America.
