26 SEEDS AND PLANTS IMPORTED.
32478 and 32479. ANNONA CHERIMOLA Miller. Cherimoya.
From Costa Rica. Presented by Mr. Carlos Werckle, San Jose. Received January 25, 1912.
"Seed from two anonas from Judge Castro Carillo. He says they are very good and of extraordinary size." (Wercklé.)
32480. AGAVE CANTALA (Haw.) Roxb. Manila maguey. From Manila, Philippine Islands. Presented by Mr. O. W. Barrett, Chief, Division of Experiment Stations, Bureau of Agriculture, through Mr. Lyster H. Dewey, of the Bureau of Plant Industry. Received January 29, 1912.
"Manila maguey is cultivated in the Philippines and to a limited extent in India, where it produces the fiber known as Bombay aloe. It is cultivated on a large scale in Java, producing a very excellent quality of fiber which has heretofore been placed on the market under the misleading name "Java sisal," The Javanese growers now pro- pose that this fiber shall be called "cantala." It grows well in Java on rich, loamy soils, where the heavy rainfall and lack of lime make it impossible to cultivate sisal or henequen to good advantage. This plant would probably grow well in the eastern part of Porto Rico." (Dewey.)
