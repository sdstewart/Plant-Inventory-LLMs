Warner of the State Board of Agriculture of South Dakota, who tested it alongside Connectient, Field, Potiron, Etampes, Tours, Large Cheese, Japanese, Cushow, Black Sugar, Gray Bologne, and Pie; while some comparators were more productive, this variety led in quality. Recommended for wide distribution for culinary use and for feeding milch cows. Reported success on rich, sandy loam; vines endured drought; fruit ripened by the beginning of September. Similar excellence was not observed in California."
