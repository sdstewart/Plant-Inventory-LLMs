Much planted to hold moving sands along the Transcaspian Railway and esteemed the best for this purpose because of its quick growth. Mr. Palettsky, the Government forestry expert overseeing this work, reported one-year-old nursery plants 5 feet high and well branched. Thrives on sand and alkali deserts; grows better when partly covered by moving sand, as branches root quickly. Wood is heavier than water and makes excellent fuel, but is too brittle and hard for use in the arts."
