Manufacturers in Rochester use about 15 tons of this material per week. There is interest in whether the palm could be cultivated successfully in Florida or other Southern States. Plants from these seeds are to be tested for suitability under conditions in southern Florida and southern California."

Selection No. C 31: Fruit closely resembles the Honey peach (a leading South China variety for this section). In 1910 this tree bore much more fruit than the Honey peach, with greater uniformity in size and ripening. Ripens about June 20, approximately one week later than the Honey peach. The tree is a vigorous grower, and Mr. G. Onderdonk recommends it as worthy of propagation."

The leaves contain a fine quality of fiber; the fruit is used by natives as a vermifuge. The plant is said to contain valuable chemical properties. Specimens were obtained from Mr. Alexander Smith, of Tampico. Distribution: Panama and the West Indies, and from Colombia to Guiana in northern South America. (Miller.)"
