A tall, foliaceous tree, sometimes attaining 100 feet, with a dark-colored, stringy bark. Timber pale-colored, darker than White-mahogany (Eucalyptus acmenoides Schau.). It is subject to attack by a borer which deteriorates its quality as a marketable timber. The wood is hard and close-grained but rather inferior to White-mahogany, a fact well known to timber-getters. Distribution: Sometimes 100 feet tall, found in the northern part of New South Wales, Australia. See Baker and Smith for further description."

Manila maguey is cultivated in the Philippines and to a limited extent in India, where it produces the fiber known as Bombay aloe. It is cultivated on a large scale in Java, producing a very excellent quality of fiber that has been marketed under the misleading name 'Java sisal'; Javanese growers propose the name 'cantala' for this fiber. The plant grows well in Java on rich, loamy soils where heavy rainfall and lack of lime make sisal or henequen cultivation impracticable. This plant would probably grow well in the eastern part of Porto Rico. (Dewey.)"
