The seeds are from a very attractive ornamental small tree much used as a border shrub and as a hedge plant for which latter purpose it is well adapted. It has a clean foliage of compound leaves, each leaf consisting of a twin pair of obovate leaflets. What makes the plant most conspicuous and attractive is its heavy burden of dense panicles of pods, open and twisted when ripe and showing the shiny-black small seeds to each of which is attached a red or a white arillus. This hedge plant would be excellently adapted to southern Florida where it may already exist."
