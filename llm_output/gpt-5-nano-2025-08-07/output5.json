      "description": "A native desert bush with linear leaves 3 inches long; attains a height of 15 feet; much planted to hold the moving sands along the Transcaspian Railway, and esteemed the best because the growth is quickest. Mr. Palettsky, the Government forestry expert in charge of this work, showed me one-year plants in nursery 5 feet high and well branched. This bush does well on sand and alkali deserts; the more it is cov-ered with moving sand the better it grows, as the branches root quickly. Wood heavier than water, good for fuel, but too brittle and hard to use in the arts."
