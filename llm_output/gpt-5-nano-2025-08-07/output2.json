Warner, of the State Board of Agriculture of South Dakota, says: \"This pumpkin was tested in comparison with Connectient, Field, Potiron, Etampes, Tours, Large Cheese, Japanese, Cushow, Black Sugar, Gray Bologne, and Pie, and while some of them were more productive, it leads them all in quality. It should be extensively distributed for culinary use and for feeding milch cows.\" According to Mr. Warner's report this noteworthy snecess was attained in rich, sandy loam; the vines bore drought and the fruit was ripe by the beginning of September. In California this excellence seems not to have been apparent. * Unless the number of plants or packages of seed is stated It is to be inferred that our stock is exhausted. Unless otherwise credited all notes in quotations are from the persons furnishing the aceda. 7"
