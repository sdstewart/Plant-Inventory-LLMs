A tall, foliaceous tree, attaining sometimes a height of 100 feet, with a dark- colored, stringy bark. Timber pale-colored, darker than 'White-mahogany,' E. acmenoides Schau. It is subject to the attacks of a borer, which, of course. deteriorates its quality as a marketable timber. It is hard, close-grained, but is rather an inferior timber to 'White-mahogany,' a fact well known to timber- getters. Distribution .- A tree sometimes 100 feet tall, found in the northern part of New South Wales, Australia."
