      "type": "Sholteek, Wild alfalfa",
      "origin": "Western Siberia",
      "presented_by": "Mr. Frank N. Meyer",

      "description": "(No. 1634a, July 18 and October 4, 1911.) The sholteek, as this wild alfalfa is generally called in western Siberia, occurs over the greater part of Eurasia, being found in the Himalayas as low down as the thirtieth degree of latitude, near Yakutsk, and in Norway between the sixtieth and seventieth parallels. There is a very great amount of variation to be observed in the wild plant; some forms grow up to from 5 to 6 feet and may be fairly erect, while others reach a height of a few inches only and are often prostrate in habit. The more prostrate forms lend themselves excellently for naturalization purposes on dry pasture grounds, while the erect varieties may be cultivated for forage purposes in sections of the United States where the ordinary alfalfa gets winter killed. The present habits of this sholteek indicate that possibly a great amount of selection and breeding may have to be done before ideal types will have been evolved, but the many excellent qualities this plant possesses, viz, the eagerness with which all sorts of domestic animals devour it, its apparently great nutritive capacities, especially for milk cows, its remarkable resistance to drought, to close grazing, and to adverse conditions in general, all seem to make it well worth while to spend some extra efforts on improvement. The roots of this sholteek also possess the capacity of producing new plants whenever cut off or when exposed to the air on account of the soil having been washed away. This characteristic is of great value in pasture grounds, where the crowns are easily damaged by the close grazing and by the hoofs of the animals trampling over them. The soil best suited to this Medicago seems to be a blackish, well-drained earth, but one also finds that it grows luxuriantly in pebbly banks and in dry cliffs composed of sandy loam. This seed should be tested especially for naturalization purposes in pasture grounds in the semiarid belt of northwestern United States."
