What makes the plant most conspicuous and attractive is its heavy burden of dense panicles of pods, open and twisted when ripe and showing the shiny-black small seeds to each of which is attached a red or a white arillus. This hedge plant would be excellently adapted to southern Florida where it may already exist."
