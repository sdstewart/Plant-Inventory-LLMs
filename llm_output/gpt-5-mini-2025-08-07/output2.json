Warner, of the State Board of Agriculture of South Dakota, reports: \"This pumpkin was tested in comparison with Connectient, Field, Potiron, Etampes, Tours, Large Cheese, Japanese, Cushow, Black Sugar, Gray Bologne, and Pie, and while some of them were more productive, it leads them all in quality. It should be extensively distributed for culinary use and for feeding milch cows.\" According to Mr. Warner's report this noteworthy success was attained in rich, sandy loam; the vines bore drought and the fruit was ripe by the beginning of September. In California this excellence seems not to have been apparent."
