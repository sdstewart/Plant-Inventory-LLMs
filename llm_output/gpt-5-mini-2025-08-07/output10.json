      "description": "The seeds of this grass were received under the name Meniauris granuleris Swartz, 1738 (Nova Genera et Species Plantarum, p. 25), which is based on Cenchrus granularis L. However, Linnaeus published in 1771 the generic name Mamisuris with one species M. myurus, which is not now considered congeneric with Cenchrus granularis L., thus invalidating the use of the generic name Mamisuris for the latter species. Kuntze proposed for Cenchrus granularis L. the name Harkelochloa (Revisio Generum Plantarum, 1891, pt. 2, p. 776). In 1830, Seringe (Bulletin Botanique, vol. 1, p. 219) published the generic name Rytilix, citing \"Manicuris granularis et myurus Auct.\" and listing one species, R. glandulosa. While there is no description, the citation of M. granularis first and the proposed R. glandulosa and the consideration that \"glandulosa\" and \"granularis\" refer to the same plant characteristic lead one to consider Manicuris granularis to be the type of the genus Rytilix. From Kirki. (No. 142, October 14, 1911.) An annual grass that may be valuable after the manner of crab-grass. Distribution.- Found throughout the tropical region of India and generally distributed in the tropics of both hemispheres."

      "description": "The seeds of this grass were received under the name Ophiuros corymbosus (L. f.) Gaertn. In publishing the genus Ophiuros, Gaertner cited Rottboellia Linn. and Juss., and described and figured two species. Under the first, O. incurvata, are cited the descriptions of Aegilops incurvata L. and Rottboellia incurvata L. f. Under the second, O. corymbosa, are cited the descriptions of Aegilopa exaltata L. and Rottboellia corymbosa L. f., the latter of which is based on Aegilopa exaltata, the specific name being changed because of Rottboellia exaltata L. f. appearing earlier on the same page of the Supplementum (1781, p. 114). The generic characterization covers both grasses; but the first species is more completely described, Gaertner not having any fertile flowers of the second, of which he remarks that it might prove to be very closely related to Digitaria if the flowers were better known. It would therefore seem necessary to consider the first species, O. incurvata, as the type of the genus Ophiuros. As Aegilops exaltata is not now considered to be congeneric with O. incurvata it must be referred to another genus. In 1829, Kunth (Revision des Graminees, vol. 1, p. 153) published the genus Mnesithea with one species, M. ferris, based on Rottboellia lorris Retzius. As this grass is considered to be congeneric with the species received as Ophiuros corymbosus, the latter is here placed in the genus Mnesithea, the earliest specific name, exaltata, being restored. From Poona. (No. 147, October 13, 1911.) A rather coarse grass, but cut for fodder. Distribution.- Found on dry hills at the base of the Himalayas, where it rises to an elevation of 3,500 feet, in the Khasi Hills and southward in the Dekkan Peninsula of India; also in the States of North Australia and Queensland in Australia."
