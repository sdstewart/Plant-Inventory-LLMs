      "description": "The button industry uses a large amount of vegetable ivory. This is the fruit of a species of palm growing wild in South America, principally in the republics of Ecuador and Colombia. The manufacturers of this city alone use of this material about 15 tons a week, and the question has often arisen as to whether the palm could not be cultivated successfully in Florida or some of the other Southern States. The plants grown from these seeds will be tested for their suitability to conditions in southern Florida and southern California."

Onderdonk, of Nursery, Tex., while on an exploration trip for the Department of Agriculture in Mexico in 1902-3. (No. C 31.) The fruit of this tree closely resembles the Honey peach, which is the best for this section of the South China varieties. In the season of 1910 this tree had much more fruit than the Honey peach, the fruit was more uniform in size, and had a more uniform ripening period. The fruit ripens about the 20th of June, and about a week later than the Honey peach. The tree is a vigorous grower, and Mr. G. Onderdonk recommends it as worthy of propagation."

The plant propagates from the seed and by starting sucker from the root or trunk. It flourishes in the lowlands or in the highlands. The plant is drowned out or destroyed if the land is flooded for a number of days. The leaves contain a fine quality of fiber. The fruit is used by the natives as a vermifuge. The plant itself is said to contain valuable chemical properties. These specimens were obtained from Mr. Alexander Smith, of Tampico. Distribution: In Panama and the West Indies, and from Colombia to Guiana in the northern part of South America."
