      "description": "The seeds of this grass were received under the name Meniauris granuleris Swartz, 1738 (Nova Genera et Species Plantarum, p. 25), which is based on Cencheus granuleris L. However, Linnaeus had published in 1771 (Mantina Plantarum, pp. 161, 300) the generic name Manisuris with one species M. myurus, which is not now considered to be congeneric with Cenekrus granuleris L., thus invalidating the use of the generic name Manisuris for the latter species. This fact was recognized by Kuntze, who proposed for Cenekrus granuleris L. the name Hackelochloa (Revisio Generum Plantarum, 1891, pt. 2, p. 776). However, in 1830, Seringe (Bulletin Botanique, vol. 1, p. 219) had published the generic name Rytilix, citing \"Manicuris granularis et myurus Auct.\" and listing one species, R. glandulosa. While there is no description, the facts that M. granularis was cited first, that the name R. glandulosa is proposed, and that \"glandulosa\" and \"granularis\" are considered to refer to the same plant characteristic, lead one to consider Manisuris granularis to be the type of the genus Rytilix. (No. 142, October 14, 1911.) An annual grass that may be valuable after the manner of crab-grass. Distribution: Found throughout the tropical region of India and is generally distributed in the Tropics of both hemispheres."

      "description": "The seeds of this grass were received under the name Ophiurus corymbosus (L. f.) Gaertn. f. In publishing the genus Ophiuros, Gaertner cited Rottboellia Linn. and Jums., and described and figured two species. Under the first, O. incurvata, are cited the descriptions of Aegilops incurvata L. and Rottboellia incurvata L. f. Under the second, O. corymbosa, are cited the descriptions of Aegilops exaltata L. and Rottboellia corymbosa L. f., the latter of which is based on Aegilops exaltata, the specific name being changed because of Rottboellia exaltata L. f. appearing earlier on the same page of the Supplementum (1781, p. 114). The generic characterization covers both grasses; but the first species is more completely described, Gaertner not having any fertile flowers of the second, of which he remarks that it might prove to be very closely related to Digitaria if the flowers were better known. It would therefore seem necessary to consider the first species, O. incurvata, as the type of the genus Ophiuros. As Aegilops exaltata is not now considered to be congeneric with O. incurvata, it must be referred to another genus. In 1829, Kunth (Revision des Gramin\u00e9es, vol. 1, p. 153) published the genus Mnesithea with one species, M. laevis, based on Rottboellia laevis Retzius. As this grass is considered to be congeneric with the species received as Ophiuros corymbosus, the latter is here placed in the genus Mnesithea, the earliest specific name, exaltata, being restored. (No. 147, October 13, 1911.) A rather coarse grass, but cut for fodder. Distribution: Found on dry hills at the base of the Himalayas, where it rises to an elevation of 3,500 feet, in the Khasi Hills and southward in the Dekkan Peninsula of India; also in the States of North Australia and Queensland in Australia."
