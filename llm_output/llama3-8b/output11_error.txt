It is subject to the attacks of a borer, which, of course, deteriorates its quality as a marketable timber. It is hard, close-grained, but is rather an inferior timber to 'White-mahogany,' a fact well known to timber-getters."

      "description": "Manila maguey is cultivated in the Philippines and to a limited extent in India, where it produces the fiber known as Bombay aloe. It is cultivated on a large scale in Java, producing a very excellent quality of fiber which has heretofore been placed on the market under the misleading name 'Java sisal,' The Javanese growers now propose that this fiber shall be called 'cantala.' It grows well in Java on rich, loamy soils, where the heavy rainfall and lack of lime make it impossible to cultivate sisal or henequen to good advantage. This plant would probably grow well in the eastern part of Porto Rico."
